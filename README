File Description
- PAGS.py includes the class declaration and implementation of our software.
- SimpleSketches.py, ListSketches.py, HashSketches.py are different implementations
of the abstract class Sketches.py
- DistanceCalculation.py is the algorithm for calculating distance between two
genomes. 
- RunTest.py and Benchmark.py are used to run benchmarks.

Generate Test Results
Use the following command:
python3 Benchmark.py file_list k p ss (sl)
file_list: name of a text file containing a list of path to fasta files of genomes to be compared
(The file list we use is test_files.txt. All the fasta files are in Genomes/)
k: kmer length (a positive number)
p: percent of total kmer to include in each sketch (a number between 0 and 1)
ss: option to take substring or subsequence as kmer. 0 for substring, 1 for subsequence
(sl): only provide if ss = 1. The length of space between each character taken
for the subsequence

The result will be written in the file "result.txt"
